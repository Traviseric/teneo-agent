# Project Tasks

This is an example task file. Copy it to `TASKS.md` and customize for your project.

## How to Write Good Tasks

- **Be specific**: "Add login form with email/password fields" not "do login"
- **One task, one outcome**: Break big features into smaller tasks
- **Include success criteria**: "Add tests that pass" or "Build must succeed"
- **Order by dependency**: Setup tasks before feature tasks

## Tips

1. Workers execute tasks top-to-bottom
2. Mark tasks `[x]` when complete (workers do this automatically)
3. Add new tasks anytime - workers pick them up next round
4. Use clear, imperative language ("Add X", "Fix Y", "Create Z")
